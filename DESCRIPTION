Description: This package is a plugin for the {rayshader} package. It provides a
  simple function to plot the elvation around a given lat lon location with a 
  specified sarch radius, for the extent of an sf(readable) object or a 
  user-provided elevation raster with a map overlay draped over the terrain. 
  terrain data (when it isn't provided) is aquired via {elevatr} and map data 
  is from {maptiles}.
